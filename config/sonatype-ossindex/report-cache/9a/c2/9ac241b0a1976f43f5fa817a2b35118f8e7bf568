{"coordinates":"pkg:maven/com.epam/parso@2.0.11","description":"Parso is a lightweight Java library designed to read SAS7BDAT datasets. The Parso interfaces\n        are analogous to libraries designed to read table-storing files, for example, CSVReader library.\n        Despite its small size, the Parso library is the only full-featured open-source solution to process SAS7BDAT\n        datasets, both uncompressed, CHAR-compressed and BIN-compressed. It is effective in processing clinical and\n        statistical data often stored in SAS7BDAT format. Parso allows converting data into CSV format.","reference":"https://ossindex.sonatype.org/component/pkg:maven/com.epam/parso@2.0.11","vulnerabilities":[]}
